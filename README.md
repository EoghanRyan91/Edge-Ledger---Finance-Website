EdgeLedger, a Fictional Financial Company's Website!

I have learned some new tricks in CSS and HTML so I decided to put together this website. I have learned and implemented the following things in this website;

 * Responsive design using CSS media queries for better flow and readability on mobile devices
 
 * Flexbox! No more using floats and margins to align divs. Flexbox makes positioning elements and alignment a breeeze!
 
 * Overlays using the CSS ::before attribute
 
 I find as I practice more and create more projects I have gotten a lot faster and better at understanding layout and positioning, aswell as ways to write clean code with semantic HTML tags. Next is javascript!
